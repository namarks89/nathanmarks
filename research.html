            <h2>language attitudes and perceptual dialectology</h2>
   <h3>ghekanye in russian</h3>
    
    <p>My <a href="FULL_VERSION_N_MARKS.pdf">dissertation</a> investigated the language attitudes toward the use of the voiced velar fricative by native Russian speakers from the city of Voronezh. The study was built upon an experimental methodology promoted and used within the field of folk linguistics, perceptual dialectology and sociolinguistics. Three questions are addressed: (1) What regions are salient in the speakers’ mind, that is have folk status? (2) For Voronezh speakers are there any status categories that are shown to be stigmatized due to the use of the voiced velar fricative in speech? (3) Do speakers of Voronezh uphold or reject myths that there is deviation within the standard and that speech in communities that contain variation are not the standard must switch to the standard for fear of being labeled as uneducated. This study employed a matched-guise technique and a language attitudes survey to explore subjective-reactions of Russian Voronezh speakers to the use of the voiced velar fricative (ghekanye) in speech. The use of the voiced velar fricative in place of the stop is a well-known phenomenon part of a larger linguistic continuum extending from southern Russia through Belarus and Ukraine. The following examples show the standard variant (1.) and the southern variant (2.). 
       <br>
       <br>
       1a. [s<sup>j</sup>n<sup>j</sup>eɡə] ‘snow-GEN.SING.’
       <br>
       1b. [got] ‘year-NOM.SING.'
       <br>
       2a. [s<sup>j</sup>n<sup>j</sup>eɣə] ‘snow-GEN.SING.’
       <br>
       2b. [ɣot] ‘year-NOM.SING.’
       <br>
      <br>
I also believe that these studies are essential to furthering general understanding of the relationship of language and space, not simply in terms of the folk beliefs that are fed into such notions, but also in terms of facilitating conditions on variation in change that have spatial significance. This can be seen in a change of pronunciational norms for certain words. What people actually say not only provides ethnographic, conversational, and other studies of language performance with their raw data but also, by exposing how different groups say things differently, feeds historical linguistics, linguistic geography, and sociolinguistics. The findings and knowledge generated as part of this project will be widely disseminated through professional presentations, publications, and web access. Finally, the research findings have the potential to transform scholar’s conceptualization and measurement of over-reward.

My dissertation shows that even in Voronezh which is located within the continuum of isoglosses where the voice velar fricative is used, that the pressure of the standard language, language standardization, and linguistic insecurity have given rise to the same stigmatization in status categories such as, education, intellect, and having a good job, as is also found among speakers from Moscow and St. Petersburg.

    <h3>perceptions of ukrainian</h3>
    
    <p>This research explores individuals’ perceptions of how Ukrainian is spoken in various regions of Ukraine. Despite work being done in the area of Perceptual Dialectology (PD) among some western European languages (such as, Egnlish, Spanish, French, and others), to date there is still a paucity of PD information about perceptions and attitudes of Ukrainian in Ukraine. A notable exception being Redkva and Stachowski’s (2019) research conducted in Chernivtsi, Ukraine inquiring “where people speak differently”.
      
This present study offers an examination of attitudes and perceptions of the Ukrainian language by respondents who have lived at least half of their life in Ukraine, who were asked to draw on a map of Ukraine - with twelve major cities and the neighboring geopolitical entities indicated on it - “where the most correct Ukrainian is spoken”, and “where is the Ukrainian that grates on one’s ears spoken”.  Recruitment for the online survey was conducted by placing ads on several Ukrainian-language Facebook pages, along with a link to the survey. The findings presented are from a total of 50 analyzed surveys.  Respondents’ maps were analyzed and compared using QGIS 3.16.2 Geographic Information System software. 
      
The research demonstrates that that there is a tug-of-war of correctness between Kyiv and Lviv as well as showing that there is an overall tendency of native speakers to evaluate the Transcarpathian region as the area that grates one’s ears.

            <h2>phonology</h2>
   <h3>variation in russian verbs</h3>
    
    <p>A paper I am working on currently deals with conjugational variation and loss of epenthetic-l in Russian verbs with a labial (P) root.

To date, much research has been conducted in shift in thematic verbal suffixes (TVS), especially in the shift from -a- to -aj-. The most common alternation within TVS consists of a shift –a- to –aj-. As a verbal group –a- verbs are not simply unproductive, but that they are continually losing verbs to the highly productive group of –aj- verbs. Despite the work being done on the shift from –a- to –aj-, there is to date paucity of work studying the surface level shift from class I (CI) to class II (CII), specifically regarding the occurrence of alternations between Plj~Pj in Russian verbal paradigms.

In order to capture the possible stradding of paradigms and overall shifting process to CII, I propose using a Stratal OT to account for varying behaviors for different classes of suffixes in Russian with respect to palatalization. Ultimately, this study has two very interesting results: 1) that, simply put, a verb will undergo suffix shift at a higher frequency if the root-final consonant is a labial and 2) using the Stratal OT account it can be shown that in the postlexical-level the combination of vowel reduction and the constraint *PljV[+front] can cause the surface form to mismatch with the underlying TVS.

   <h2>phonetics</h2>
   <h3>peculiarities in BCMS VOT</h3>
   
   <p>I have an ongoing study on VOT in Bosnian-Croatian-Montenegrin-Serbian (BCMS) that examines the interactions in VOT between singleton modal stops and the stops in liquid sonorant consonant clusters containing /l/ and /r/. The words in this study were spoken in isolation and in sentence context by 22 native speakers from ages 33-67. Spectrograms were made and VOT duration measurements were taken. If we look at length of release burst and compare them across all environments not caring about voiced vs voiceless, the interactions are the same, meaning the burst becomes longer as we move from singleton to cluster (C -> Cr -> Cl), but what I also found is that both /g/ and /k/ behave similarly and not like the other stop consonants, where the Cr cluster is in fact the shortest with respect to release burst, then the singleton then the Cl cluster.
